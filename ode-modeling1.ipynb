The basic approach we will use to calculate changes in the quantity of different molecules are  differential equations, which are simply a way of describing the instanteous change in a quantity of interest.  \n",

If $\\frac{dy}{dt}$ is positive than the concentration of gene $Y$ is increasing, if $\\frac{dy}{dt}$ is negative the concentration of $Y$ is decreasing, and if $\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0$ than $Y$ is at steady state."

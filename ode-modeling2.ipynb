      "We're now going to use some of these tools to look at a class of network motifs, called Feed Forward Loops (FFLs), found in signaling and regulatory networks. FFLs involve interactions between three components, with the basic topology illustrated below. Depending on the signs of the edges (whether activating or repressing) we can classify FFLs as \"coherent\" or \"incoherent.\" We'll take a look at an example of each class."
